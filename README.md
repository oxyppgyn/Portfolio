## About Me
<img align="right" src="https://github.com/oxyppgyn/Portfolio/blob/main/Images/Self.png" alt="Me :)" width="275"/>
My name is Tanner Hammond and I'm currently a student at Ohio University studying Environmental Geography with minors in Biological Sciences and Plant & Environmental Biology. I am also pursuing a certificate in Geographic Information Science. Research topics I'm interested in include restoration ecology, biogeography, invasive species management, citizen science data usage, and cultural-natural resource management. 

I've previously worked for the Ross County Park District as a trail intern and at the National Park Service (Hopewell Culture National Historical Park) as a biological science aid. I'm currently working on improving my skills with GIS, python, and species identification. My current projects focus primarily on using citizen science data for species abundance.

### <a href="https://github.com/oxyppgyn/Building-Accessibility-OU">Building Accessibility at Ohio University</a>
Completed as a final project for GEOG 2680: Introduction to GIS, I mapped the accessibility of buildings on Ohio University's Athens campus. A basic ranking matrix was used to quantitatively evaluate differences in building accessibility. This project was a good introduction to collecting GIS field data after learning the basics of using ArcGIS Online. (<a href="https://github.com/oxyppgyn/Building-Accessibility-OU">Link</a>).
