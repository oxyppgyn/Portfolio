# About me
<img align="right" src="https://github.com/oxyppgyn/Portfolio/blob/main/Images/Self.png" alt="Me :)" width="275"/>
<p>My name is Tanner Hammond and I'm currently a student at Ohio University studying Environmental Geography and Environmental Biology with a minor in Plant & Environmental Biology. I am also pursuing a certificate in Geographic Information Science.</p>
<p>Research topics I'm interested in include population ecology, restoration ecology, biogeography, invasive species management, citizen science data usage, and cultural-natural resource management.</p>
<p>I've previously worked for the Ross County Park District as a trail intern (Summer 2022) and at the National Park Service (Hopewell Culture National Historical Park) as a biological science aid (Summer 2023). I'm currently working on improving my skills with GIS, python, and species identification. My current project involves determining deer population ecology using trail cameras.<p/>

## Current & Upcoming
### Interactive NPSpecies Map Application (_Upcoming_)
Currently, NPSpecies does not provide an interactive map despite being composed of largely spatial data. I plan to utilize the existing REST API for NPSpecies data through Integrated Resource Management Applications (IRMA) to create an automatically updating mapping application that allows easy viewing and filtering of species data and automatic interpolation of data.

### Population characteristics and water usage of white-tailed deer (_Odocoileus virginianus_) at Hopewell Mound Group, Hopewell Culture National Historical Park
This project uses trail cameras to determine a baseline deer population density estimate and population characteristics data for Hopewell Mound Group. Deer water use and behavior near watering sites will also be assessed.

## August 2023
### GIS Standards Documentation and Tools for Hopewell Culture National Historical Park
<p>During my summer at Hopewell Culture National Historical Park (HOCU), I worked with the park's cultural resources staff to determine the best methods for implementing a GIS data management strategy for the park. We concluded that using the standards developed by the National Park Service in the mid-2010s should be used as the basis for data management, despite some apparent gaps in guidance when handling certain data type and edge cases. Note that the original document and ArcGIS toolbox is a product of and property of the National Park Service and is not publicly available.

### <a href="https://github.com/oxyppgyn/HOCU-Birding-List-2023-Update">Birding Checklist for Hopewell Culture National Historical Park</a>
Created as an update to the previous 1999–2000 checklist that was created for Mound City Group. Data from surveys conducted as part of the Heartland Network, iNaturalist observations, eBird range maps, and _The ritual mnemonics of Hopewell symbols: An analysis of effigies and ceremonial regalia from Tremper, Mound City and Hopewell_ by Bretton Giles was used when compiling this checklist. Multiple species from the original checklist were removed based on abundance data, notably including the ivory-billed woodpecker which was last officially seen in 1944.

Note: The included image is only part of the full checklist. View the full version [here](https://github.com/oxyppgyn/Portfolio/blob/main/Images/HOCU%20Birding%20Checklist.pdf).

### <a href="https://github.com/oxyppgyn/Building-Accessibility-OU">Building Accessibility at Ohio University</a>
<p>Completed as a group final project for GEOG 2680: Introduction to GIS. For this project, I mapped the accessibility of buildings on Ohio University's Athens campus using ArcGIS Survey123. A basic ranking matrix was used to quantitatively evaluate differences in building accessibility–this included the presence and need of entrance ramps, accessible/powered doors, and elevators in buldings. This project provided a good introduction to the basics of geographic information science, ArcGIS Pro and ArcGIS Online, and collecting GIS field data.<p/>
