### Building Accessibility at Ohio University

This project worked as an introduction to collecting GIS field data after learning the basics of using ArcGIS Online. 
Map detailing the accessibility ranking of buildings at Ohio University in Athens, Ohio. Accessibility was ranked on a scale of 0 - 3 based on if a building had an elevator (when needed), if the building had accessible automatic doors, and if the accessible door (or other main door if no accessible doors were present) had a ramp to it. When looking at ramps, ADA accessible ramps (<5 degree incline) were considered good. One point was awarded for each of the criteria met.
Points on map were placed at the location of the most accessible entrance found on the building or main entrance if no accessible door was found.
